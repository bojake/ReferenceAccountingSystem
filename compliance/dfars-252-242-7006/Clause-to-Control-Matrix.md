# Clause-to-Control Matrix

Evidence output root:
- `GovConMoney.Tests/Runner/AuditBinderOutput/<timestamp_guid>/`
- Generated by test case: `Generate auditor binder evidence package` in `GovConMoney.Tests/Program.cs`
- Verification run: `dotnet run --project GovConMoney.Tests/GovConMoney.Tests.csproj` on `2026-02-16` (all listed cited tests passed).
- Management-review update: periodic internal audit cycle + attestation workflow implemented and evidenced via internal-audit binder artifacts.
