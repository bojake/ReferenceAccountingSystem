# DFARS 252.242-7006 Compliance Assessment

Date: 2026-02-16
Scope: Clause-by-clause status for the 18 items in `dfars.txt`.
Status values: `Complete`, `Partial`, `Planned`, `Absent`.
Evidence output root: `GovConMoney.Tests/Runner/AuditBinderOutput/<timestamp_guid>/` (generated by test `Generate auditor binder evidence package` in `GovConMoney.Tests/Program.cs`).

## Management Review Update (2026-02-16)
- Periodic internal audit and attestation workflow is now implemented as part of management review controls.
- Required attestations (manager/compliance) are policy-driven via `ManagementReviewPolicy`.
- Review lifecycle now supports explicit stages: `Draft -> PendingAttestation -> Submitted -> Approved -> Closed`.
- Checklist failures generate tracked compliance exceptions.
- Close is blocked when exceptions are open; manager can resolve or accept risk before close.
- Maker-checker is enforced for review approval (approver cannot be submitter).
- New evidence artifacts:
  - `internal_audit_compliance.csv`
  - `internal_audit_cycles.csv`
  - `internal_audit_attestations.csv`
  - `compliance_review_summary.csv`
  - `compliance_review_checklist.csv`
  - `compliance_exceptions.csv`
  - `compliance_attestations.csv`
- Clause `(8)` status is `Complete` based on implemented workflow + passing tests.

- Periodic internal audit cycles are generated per accounting period and tracked to completion.
- Checklist completion is required before cycle submission for attestation.
- Manager and compliance attestations are captured as explicit records and can be configured by policy.
- Review submission requires checklist results and attestation evidence.
- Manager approval uses maker-checker controls (submitter cannot approve).
- Failed checklist items generate exceptions with remediation ownership and due dates.
- Review close is blocked while exceptions remain open; manager risk-acceptance is supported.
- Audit trail search and export are available.
- Manager review events are captured for evidence packages.

Validation tests
- `Non-assigned charge code rejected`
- `Out-of-window charging needs supervisor approval`
- `Daily entry grace policy blocks late bulk entry on submit`

Evidence output
- `timesheets_packet.csv`
- `timesheet_compliance.csv`

## (10) Labor distribution charges direct/indirect labor to proper objectives

Implemented: `Complete`

Files
- `GovConMoney.Application/Services/BillingService.cs`
- `GovConMoney.Application/Services/TimesheetService.cs`

## (14) Segregation of preproduction costs from production costs (as applicable)
Implemented: `Planned`

Files
- `N/A`

How it works
- No explicit preproduction/production classification model exists today.

Validation tests
- `N/A`

Evidence output
- `N/A`

Minimal implementation plan
- Add cost phase dimension (`Preproduction`, `Production`) on timesheet/expense/burden and reporting.
- Add validation/policy rules by contract/CLIN where required.
- Add reconciliation/report artifacts by phase.

Human policy engagement
- Determining when a program transitions from preproduction to production is a contract/program governance decision and requires documented policy and approval records.

Implemented: `Complete`

Files
- `GovConMoney.Application/Services/BillingService.cs`
- `GovConMoney.Domain/Entities/Invoice.cs`

Validation tests
- `Payroll import reconciles to posted labor`
- `Generate auditor binder evidence package`

Evidence output
- `labor_distribution.csv`
- `project_summary.csv`
- `audit_trail.csv`

Gaps
- No dedicated estimating/pricing package builder (basis-of-estimate workflow, versioned assumptions, proposal snapshots).

Human policy engagement
- Adequacy for follow-on pricing depends on estimating policies, BOE methodology, and management review practices.
