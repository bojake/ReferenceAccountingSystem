# GovConMoney System Architecture

Date: 2026-02-16

## 1. Overview

GovConMoney is a multi-tenant government-contractor accounting platform built on .NET and Blazor Server.  
It combines timekeeping, accounting, compliance, billing, and audit evidence generation in a single system.

This system is designed to support an accounting system adequacy demonstration by generating reproducible evidence artifacts aligned to DFARS 252.242-7006 criteria.

Primary goals:
- Enforce role-based financial controls.
- Keep auditable, append-only event history.
- Support DFARS/DCAA-oriented reporting and audit binder outputs.

Management review architecture update:
- Management-review controls now include a periodic internal-audit and attestation subsystem.
- Policy configuration governs cadence, due window, and required attestation roles.
- Workflow now includes checklist scoring, exception tracking, maker-checker approval, and controlled close.

## 2. Runtime Topology

Main runtime components:
- `GovConMoney.Web` (Blazor Server UI + minimal API endpoints + auth + hosted jobs)
- `GovConMoney.Application` (business services, workflow logic, reporting/export)
- `GovConMoney.Domain` (entities, enums, domain records)
- `GovConMoney.Infrastructure` (EF Core DbContext, tenant scoping, repository, audit context)
- `GovConMoney.Tests` (scenario-style integration tests + binder artifact generation)

Execution model:
- Request/response workflows run in web/API endpoints.
- Domain logic executes in application services.
- Persistence is handled via EF Core through repository abstractions.
- Daily compliance cadence monitoring runs as a hosted background service.

## 3. Layered Architecture

    Blazor UI/API -> Application Services -> EF Core DbContext -> SQL 
                      |
                      v
              AuditEvent append-only log
                      |
                      v
             Evidence Binder Export (Tests)

### 3.1 Presentation and API Layer
- Entry point: `GovConMoney.Web/Program.cs`
- Blazor pages under `GovConMoney.Web/Components/Pages/*`
- API/form endpoints for operational actions (timesheets, approvals, close, billing, reporting)

### 3.2 Application Service Layer
Key services:
- `TimesheetService` (draft/submit/approve/correct + expense flow)
- `AccountingService` (posting operations)
- `IndirectRateService` (compute/apply/rerate + manager review for final rates)
- `JournalEntryWorkflowService` (adjusting JE maker-checker workflow)
- `BillingService` (billing run generation, approval, posting, reconciliation)
- `CloseService` (pre-close validation, period close, tie-out, trial balance)
- `MonthlyCloseComplianceService` (close cadence reporting)
- `ReportingService` (operational/compliance reports + export support)

### 3.3 Domain Layer
Core entities include:
- Organizational/compliance: `Tenant`, `AppUser`, `ManagementReviewPolicy`, `AuditEvent`
- Timekeeping: `Timesheet`, `TimesheetLine`, `TimesheetExpense`, `CorrectionRequest`
- Contract hierarchy: `Contract`, `TaskOrder`, `Clin`, `WbsNode`, `ChargeCode`
- Accounting: `ChartOfAccount`, `JournalEntry`, `JournalLine`, `AccountingPeriod`
- Indirect engine: `IndirectPool`, `AllocationBase`, `RateCalculation`, `AppliedBurdenEntry`
- Billing: `BillingRun`, `Invoice`, `InvoiceLine`, `BilledCostLink`, `BillingCeiling`

### 3.4 Infrastructure Layer
- `GovConMoney.Infrastructure/Persistence/GovConMoneyDbContext.cs`
- Tenant query filtering via `TenantId`.
- Append-only and immutability enforcement for audit and ledger entities.
- In-memory persistence and test harness support in `Infrastructure/Persistence/*`.

## 4. Data and Tenancy Architecture

Multi-tenant model:
- Business entities implement tenant scoping and include `TenantId`.
- Global query filters enforce tenant isolation in EF Core.

Control-oriented data behavior:
- `AuditEvent` is append-only (no update/delete).
- `JournalLine` is immutable.
- Posted/reversed `JournalEntry` records are immutable except controlled reversal status transition.

## 5. Security Architecture

Authentication and authorization:
- ASP.NET Core Identity + cookie authentication in `GovConMoney.Web/Program.cs`.
- Role policies (`Admin`, `Compliance`, `TimeReporter`, `Supervisor`, `Accountant`, `Manager`).
- Manager/accountant split used in financial approvals.

Hardening controls:
- Secure cookie settings.
- Rate limiting for auth endpoints.
- Passkey/WebAuthn services in `GovConMoney.Web/Security/*`.

## 6. Core Business Workflows

### 6.1 Timekeeping and Posting
1. Time reporter creates/submits timesheet.
2. Supervisor approves.
3. Accountant posts approved time to ledger.
4. Compliance and audit events are captured.

### 6.2 Indirect Rate Lifecycle
1. Accountant computes rates from posted books.
2. Final rates move to manager review lifecycle.
3. Manager approves/rejects final rates.
4. Burden is applied (and optionally rerated) and can be posted to GL.

### 6.3 Billing Lifecycle
1. Accountant generates billing run from posted allowable costs.
2. Threshold policy may require manager approval.
3. Approved billing run is posted to GL and invoices.
4. Billed-to-booked reconciliation is produced.

### 6.4 Period Close and Monthly Cadence
1. Pre-close validation checks tie-outs and accounting prerequisites.
2. Manager closes accounting period.
3. Monthly close compliance service reports overdue periods.
4. Hosted daily job emits compliance/escalation notifications for overdue periods.

### 6.5 Periodic Internal Audit and Attestation
1. Internal audit cycles are synchronized from accounting periods.
2. Clause checklist items are auto-seeded and scored (`Pass/Fail/NA`) per review period.
3. Failed checklist items open tracked compliance exceptions with owner/due date.
4. Cycle is submitted for attestation after checklist completion.
5. Attestation records are captured explicitly (manager/compliance roles).
6. Review submission requires checklist evidence and at least one attestation.
7. Manager approval enforces maker-checker (submitter cannot approve).
8. Review close is blocked while exceptions are open, unless manager resolves or accepts risk.
9. Compliance report tracks overdue cycles, attestation completion, and open exceptions.

This supports DFARS 252.242-7006(c)(11) routine posting and interim cost determination.

## 7. Reporting and Audit Evidence Architecture

Report and export mechanisms:
- API report endpoints in `GovConMoney.Web/Program.cs` (CSV/JSON).
- Report composition in `GovConMoney.Application/Services/ReportingService.cs`.
- Export formatter in `ExportService` (CSV/JSON).

Audit binder generation:
- Implemented in `GovConMoney.Tests/Program.cs` test `Generate auditor binder evidence package`.
- Output root: `GovConMoney.Tests/Runner/AuditBinderOutput/<timestamp_guid>/`.

Current binder artifacts include:
- `timesheets_packet`
- `timesheet_compliance`
- `labor_distribution`
- `project_summary`
- `clin_summary`
- `indirect_rate_support`
- `applied_burden_summary`
- `general_journal`
- `trial_balance`
- `subledger_gl_tieout`
- `monthly_close_compliance`
- `internal_audit_compliance`
- `internal_audit_cycles`
- `internal_audit_attestations`
- `compliance_review_summary`
- `compliance_review_checklist`
- `compliance_exceptions`
- `compliance_attestations`
- `unallowable_costs`
- `invoices`
- `invoice_lines`
- `billed_cost_links`
- `billed_to_booked_reconciliation`
- `adjusting_je_packet`
- `manager_review_events`
- `audit_trail`

## 8. Background Processing

Hosted service:
- `GovConMoney.Web/Services/MonthlyCloseComplianceHostedService.cs`
- Registered in `GovConMoney.Web/Program.cs` with `AddHostedService`.
- Runs periodic checks for overdue open accounting periods and sends notifications/escalations.

## 9. Test Architecture

Test runner:
- `GovConMoney.Tests/Program.cs`
- Scenario tests validate control behavior (security, workflows, accounting, reconciliation, compliance reporting).

Coverage style:
- End-to-end service-level checks in an in-memory environment.
- Binder-generation scenario verifies creation of required audit artifacts.

## 10. Known Architectural Gaps

Current intentional/known gaps:
- No full FAR limitation-clause notice/escalation workflow model.
- No explicit preproduction vs production cost-phase model yet.
- No CAS-specific rules engine/mapping repository.

These gaps are reflected in compliance statuses in `compliance.md` and `Clause-to-Control-Matrix.md`.
